      `1. First and foremost: make sure you know JavaScript well! Having a solid foundation in JavaScript (especially ES6+) will really making learning React a lot easier. Get super comfortable with objects and arrays… and with the map, filter, and reduce methods - and then you’ll have very little trouble with React.`,
      `2. From there, start with the official docs. Everyone says that about [insert library], but the React docs are really well done! Plus, they’re always current… and there is a lot of outdated “learn React” stuff out there. (And things move/change fast in the land of JS, so if you’re learning it you might as well learn the most current methods.)`,
      `3. Try building out some REALLY basic stuff to start, just to get a feel for how things work in React… things like JSX, props, and state… and how the React lifecycle methods work.`,
      `4. From that point… you will want to expand and build on this new knowledge base. (And you’ll probably be excited to do it. React is amazing!) How YOU do that really depends on your preferred learning method: try some online tutorials and/or online courses at places like Egghead or Udemy, find some tutorials on YouTube (be mindful of the date!), or find some interesting React-based projects on Github and look over the code, etc`,

      `ExpressJS is a web application framework that provides you with a simple API to build websites, web apps and back ends. With ExpressJS, you need not worry about low level protocols, processes, etc.`,
      `Express provides a minimal interface to build our applications. It provides us the tools that are required to build our app. It is flexible as there are numerous modules available on npm, which can be directly plugged into Express. 
       Express was developed by TJ Holowaychuk and is maintained by the Node.js foundation and numerous open source contributors`,
      `Unlike its competitors like Rails and Django, which have an opinionated way of building applications, Express has no "best way" to do something. It is very flexible and pluggable.`,

      `MongoDB is a flexible, scalable document database offering powerful storage and analytics capabilities. It’s also free. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, which enables users to work with different types of data`,
      `1. Free to use . This speaks for itself. Instead of paying for database software that’s less flexible and lacks a strong community, you can learn MongoDB and save the money. There’s even a free version in the cloud with the free trial version of MongoDB Atlas. The software is also transparent and easy to modify, which gives developers the power to make it their own based on their needs.`,
      `2. Makes complex tasks easy for developers . MongoDB’s document-oriented model can be used with many programming languages to meet the complex development requirements of modern apps. While it can handle complex tasks, it’s not complicated to learn, and most developers get the hang of it quickly.`,
      `3. Flexible and future-proof
      Using a rigid database system forces you to keep your data in a certain form and often locks you into whichever vendor you start with. The flexibility of MongoDB means this isn’t an issue, and you can use new data structures when you want to.`,
